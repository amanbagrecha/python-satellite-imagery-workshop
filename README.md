The content of this workshop is in a jupyter notebook (`Python_satellite_imagery_workshop.ipynb`) that is set up to run in a Docker environment. Install [Docker] if you have not already done so.

Build the docker container:

`./build`

This will take 10 minutes or so.

Run the jupyter kernel within the docker environment:
